# Git Definitions



* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a process that keeps track of changes and additions made to a project over time and by different users. It's useful because it allows multiple people to work on the same files and projects at once while minimizing conflicts. It also keeps track of changes and who made them which can help if you have to track a problem back to its source.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branches are like off shoots of the master project files. They copy the file and allow a user to make changes and edits without disturbing the master files. You would use one anytime you were going to work on changes or additions to a project so you don't end up deleting or otherwise compromising the master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is like a save point. It saves your progress but keeps those saved changes on your branch until you merge it with the master branch. A good commit message clearly outlines the changes made to the file and the reasons for those changes.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two or more branches fail to merge because of a conflict in the code. For example, if two people alter the same lines of code in different ways, git  won't know which to choose during a merge and will not be able to complete the process.
