#Linux
##Key Philosophies 
Linux is open source. Unlike a Mac or Windows OS, Linux does not try to prevent the user from accessing anything about the OS. It assumes users understand computers, software, and how they work. 
##VPS 
A VPS is a virtual computer that can run it's own OS and can be accessed from your home computer (or really any computer). 
You might use one if you need your own server (beyond what something like wordpress) but can't afford it. 
##Run programs as root? 
Never. Huge security risk. Leaves you open to viruses or harmful bugs in programs. Could corrupt entire system.
