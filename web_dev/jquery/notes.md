Jquery study notes.

Plan: spend 20 minutes searching for Documentation, helpful starter articles, a sample video. 

practice a few things in sublime (use your practice js folder) 

result: This plan worked out pretty good with some flexibility. I spent about 30 minutes reading about what jquery is, how it was developed, why it can make working with the DOM easier and more dynamic. This was great because I had an idea of what to expect when working with it. 

My vanilla javascript skills aren't really that great so at first I was writing some examples form the jquery website and not really understanding what they were doing. This prompted me to take a break and review some general javascript stuff. As soon as I went back to jquery I could see how it made selecting elements easier. I didn't get to play around with too many functions or effects but I'm now fully aware that they exist which is wonderful!
